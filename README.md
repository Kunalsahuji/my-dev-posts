## 📢 Ongoing Series: Daily Full Stack LinkedIn Posts

### 📝 Daily Posting Plan:
I'm currently sharing a **#100DaysOfMERN** journey on LinkedIn, where I post **daily full stack developer topics** that are short, insightful, and beginner-friendly. This series is tailored for anyone learning or growing in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack.

Each post includes:
- 🔹 Easy explanations of key concepts
- 🔹 Code snippets and real project examples
- 🔹 Topics like JSON, APIs, React hooks, Express middleware, deployment tips, etc.
- 🔹 🔒 Security best practices like .env usage
- 🔹 🧠 Pro dev tips with clean VS Code setups

These posts aim to make learning fun, consistent, and practical — perfect for devs leveling up in MERN!

### 📦 GitHub Repo for Daily Posts:
All posts are available here with code files and folder structures you can clone and explore:
🔗 [my-dev-posts GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Kunalsahuji/my-dev-posts)

### 💻 VS Code Folder Format:
Each day’s topic is saved in a structured folder inside the repo:
```
my-dev-posts/
├── day-1-json-vs-xml/
├── day-2-api-basics/
├── day-3-express-middleware/
├── day-4-routing-in-node/
├── day-5-env-files/
└── ... and growing
```
With clear `README.md`, working code, `.env`, `.gitignore`, and example responses — making it easy to copy and run in your local dev setup.

### 🗂️ Notion for Planning:
I’m tracking post topics, schedules, and ideas in my Notion board:
